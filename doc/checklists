checklists are only applicable for link records
link records are only queried for subforms, so checklists are only applicable for subforms

link_* config settings are only applicable to checklists

there are two different types of link records (causing the confusion)
there are link tables, like hazard_control_links
then there are checklist link records, derived from the link_* settings in the form config
link_* records are typically derived from link tables, but they correspond to checklist selections

when you inline edit a checklist link record, you can only edit fields in the link_fields list setting,
which are fields that must be in the link table (not the main subform list table)

the main subform list table is a reference to the source of all the records that can be checked in the checklist
the link_* data source refers to where the checklist selections are stored


assume for example you have three tables:
- locations
- widgets
- location_widget_links

subform_location_widgets.list is the controller for a subform within the location edit page

in subform_location_widgets.list:

    "primary_key": "widget_id",
    "command_caption_noun": "Widget",
    "multi_row_delete": false,
    "delete_cmd": false,
    "edit_cmd": "button",
    "edit_cmd_page_id": "widgets",
    "edit_button_caption": "Edit Widget",
    "edit_cmd_id": "widget_id",
    "database": "mydb",
    "table": "widgets",
    "records_sql": "widgets_checklist", # <== can optionally use for basis of a checklist subform instead of database and table

    "checklist": true,
    "parent_key": "location_id",
    "link_key": "widget_id",
    "link_database": "mydb",
    "link_table": "location_widget_links",
    "link_fields": [], # <== can optionally use to include controls for fields within the link table

    "default_filter": "my_filter", # <== filtering is optional
    "filter_cookie": false,
    "filter_options": {
        "my_filter": "(some_field='some_value')"
    }



"checklist_sort": "", # checked items stay in same sort order as normal
"checklist_sort": "top", # checked items at the top
