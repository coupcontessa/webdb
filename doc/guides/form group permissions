you can control access to a specific forms by adding to the $settings["permissions"]["forms"] array

permissions are whitelist-based; if there are any permissions set for a given form, anyone outside those permissions will be denied access

however, any form without permissions is assumed to be accessible for reading, updating and deleting of records by all users

in the any of the settings php files (webdb/common/application), add group permissions to specific forms using the following convention:

$settings["permissions"]["group_name"]["forms"]["page_id"]="riud";

the permission value consists of a string containing any mixture of "r", "i", "u" and "d"

"r" is for reading records
"i" is for inserting records
"u" is for updating records
"d" is for deleting records

if a user attempts an action on one or more records associated with a form and isn't a member of a group with permission to perform that action, an error message will be shown

if a permission is set more than once, the last setting will be used
