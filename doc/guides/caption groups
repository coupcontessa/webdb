A caption group consist of bordered column header that spans a number of related data field columns, with bold
vertical borders running down the outside of the data columns to distinguish the group of fields.

On modern browsers, the caption cell for the group should stick to the top of the window when scrolling down a long
list of records.

If there are two adjacent groups, they will share a common bold vertical border.


CONFIGURATION
=============

When setting up a caption group in the form config file, noting that field column order is set by the control types array,
caption groups must consist of a set of adjacent fields in the same order as in the control types array.
