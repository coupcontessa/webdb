computed fields are calculated on display (either in a list row, edit form or inline edit row)

can be dependent on or be stored in a database field, but doesn't require a database field

can be calculated based on multiple other database fields in a record

can be any data/control type

the following section of a form config must be added for computed fields (in addition to entries in the control_type, visible, captions, etc arrays:

    "computed_values": {
        "my_computed_field": "\\namespace\\function_name"
    },

include a php file created in the application root directory into the application index script before including the webdb index script

computed field functions must accept two arguments (can each be any name):
- string containing field name
- associative array containing complete record

the return value from the function is assigned to the field value that is displayed

function function_name($field_name,$field_data)
{
  return $some_computed_value;
}
