you can control access to a specific template by adding to the $settings["permissions"]["group_name"]["templates"] array

permissions are whitelist-based; if there are any permissions set for a given template, anyone not explicitly given permission will be denied access
- if a permission exists, everyone requiring access will need to be assigned to a permitted group
- any template without permissions is assumed to be accessible for reading by all users

in the any of the settings php files (webdb/common/application), add group permissions to specific templates using the following convention:

$settings["permissions"]["group_name"]["templates"]["template_name"]="template_name_on_success";
if template name on success is blank, the original template_name will be returned, but you can substitute a template that is group-specific

if a permission is set more than once, the last setting will be used
