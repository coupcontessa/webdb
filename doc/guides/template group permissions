you can control access to a specific template by adding to the $settings["permissions"]["templates"] array

permissions are whitelist-based; if there are any permissions set for a given template, anyone outside those permissions will be denied access

any template without permissions is assumed to be accessible for reading by all users

in the application settings.php file, add group permissions to specific templates using the following convention:

$settings["permissions"]["templates"]["template_name"]=array();
$settings["permissions"]["templates"]["template_name"]["group_name"]="r";

a permission value of "r" indicates read permission

there are no other permissions applicable to templates

if a user isn't a member of a group with permission to read a template, an empty string will be output
