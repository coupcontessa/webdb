you can control access to a specific template by inserting a line at the beginning of the file that contains a prefix and a comma-delimited list of group names

the prefix is defined as a constant in the webdb index.php file

it must be the first line of the file, and cannot contain anything in that line other than the prefix and group list

this line will not be shown in the output of the template

if a user isn't a member of a group with permission to view the template, an empty string will be output
