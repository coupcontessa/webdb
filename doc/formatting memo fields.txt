create files under the format_tags subdirectory of the templates directory
(specified by the format_tag_templates_subdirectory setting)

each formatting tag must have two files named per the following convention:

tag_open.htm
tag_close.htm

tag can be anything


to use tags in memo fields, the user surrounds their piece of text with <tag>text</tag>

you can create a format_tags subdirectory in your application, which will override the webdb templates
and allow you to make application-specific formatting
