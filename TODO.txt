HIGH PRIORITY:

- form config field help template popups (? button, make popup draggable)
- performance auditing
- insert document attachment bug
- need to clarify "assigned" and "unassigned" in advanced search tips
- sysadmin email alerts for different events
- for lookup fields, automatically sort by display field ratlher than underlying id
- friendly ajax error pages/messages
- basic search feature (key fields, uses implicit wildcards)
- report/form generator with field grid, custom sql memo and query templates (with add/remove template)

############################################################################################################
LOW PRIORITY:

- ability to edit all records at once
- xdebug performance auditing
- dynamic filtering for reports
- setting to adjust column heading rotation angle
- group header text colors
- friendly error message when deleting record fails due to foreign key
- edit all by selection/filter to change common field values (sort of like AutoCAD properties)
- pdf printing on server (using TCPDF or FPDF, or maybe wkhtmltopdf if you can get a decent webkit layout to work)

messenger:
- add anchor to URLs
- indicate channels with new comments since last viewed
- do server broadcasts for joins/parts for all users viewing. use online user list code to tell based on chat update parameter. don't save broadcast to database
- /del <channel> (cannot be currently viewing, make fail if channel contains messages unless force param is used, include confirmation prompt
- /purge_empty (except for currently viewing)
- /export (saves chat to file)
- ability to organise channels into a tree structure
  /child <parent_channel>
  /link <parent_channel> (creates link in tree only)?
  /move <timerange> <nicklist> <tochannel> (if tochannel doesn't exist, create it) (use same time format as displayed in chat window)
  /copy <timerange> <nicklist> <tochannel> (if tochannel doesn't exist, create it) (use same time format as displayed in chat window)
