=============

* for list insert row comboboxes applicable to unique fields, filter out any options that are already used (need a 'unique_fields' section of the form config)

* specify hashing algorithm constant in an app setting. consider using PASSWORD_DEFAULT by default instead of PASSWORD_BCRYPT so that if in the
  future when PHP updates PASSWORD_DEFAULT from BCRYPT to a more secure algorithm, you can automatically take advantage of that (future-proof)
  need to change password_bcrypt_cost setting if doing this

* if a field is set to non-visible, don't show it in the individual edit/insert page (put a hidden field set to default value, or nothing for spans)

* add 'where' setting to lookups for simple conditions (eg: "where": "boolean_field=1")
* record/data-specific form permissions (eg: only group working on a job able to update records related to that job)

* for individual record edit page, disable update button by default, when user changes value of field highlight it and enable update button
* when updating individual record, show something to indicate if update was successful (status bar of sorts, or via update button enabled status?)
* change update caption to "Save %% Record"

* doc/guides content

* change delete individual record from subform list into a popup with ajax (optional, similar to edit)
* incorporate foreign key check in individual record delete
* don't show delete button or select checkbox for a record if list record is referenced by a foreign key (leave foreign key check for deletion confirmation though)

* make brute-force attacks costly
  - if multiple failed attempts are made against an account, introduce a forced delay between attempts
  - eg: after 5 failed attempts force a 5 second delay between subsequent attempts, after 10 failed attempts force a 15 second delay
    between attempts, after 15 attempts introduce a 1 day block for the IP address
    or block account and email user to reinstate a new password

* when clicking update in individual record edit page, on page load show dialog indicating success/failure of update
* combine inline edit row ajax reset and controls requests into one
* for lookup fields, automatically sort by display field ratlher than underlying id
* delete record page (or just go straight to ajax deletion)
* friendly ajax error pages/messages

* basic search feature (key fields, uses implicit wildcards)
* ability to edit all records at once
* friendly error message when deleting record fails due to foreign key
* dynamic filtering for reports

* email alert
 - daily crontab
 - specify date field
 - specify days to alert prior to date (default 0)
 - specify user/group recipients
 - only one message per user per day

low priority
============

* lookup custom sql
* change password page styling
* edit all by selection/filter to change common field values (sort of like AutoCAD properties)
* pdf printing on server (using TCPDF or FPDF, or maybe wkhtmltopdf if you can get a decent webkit layout to work)
* report/form generator with field grid, custom sql memo and query templates (with add/remove template)
* setting to adjust column heading rotation angle
* group header text colors
* lookups with constant list
* memo field format tools (html tags)
* column sorting ascending/descending
* opaque column header background (need to consider draw order)

* record locking
  - use record locks table
  - when record is edited, add a lock record
  - if someone else attempts to edit the same record, display lock error message
  - ajax request to update list lock indicators every minute or so (not full page refresh)
  - add ajax request every minute to check if any records in the viewed list are locked,
    or if there have been any changes (check by querying to webdb mysql_log table)
  - if records have been changed, update data table (without refreshing page) and display
    alert bar along top of screen
  - if user clicks edit before data has had a chance to update, display latest data in
    edit form but alert the user (alert bar along top of screen) that data has changed

* event handlers
  - on_field_default_value
  - on_form_dispatch_begin
  - on_form_dispatch_end
  - on_user_authenticate
