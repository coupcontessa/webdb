low priority
============

* lookup custom sql
* edit all by selection/filter to change common field values (sort of like AutoCAD properties)
* pdf printing on server (using TCPDF or FPDF, or maybe wkhtmltopdf if you can get a decent webkit layout to work)
* report/form generator with field grid, custom sql memo and query templates (with add/remove template)
* setting to adjust column heading rotation angle
* group header text colors
* lookups with constant list
* memo field format tools (html tags)
* column sorting ascending/descending
* opaque column header background (need to consider draw order)

* record locking
  - use record locks table
  - when record is edited, add a lock record
  - if someone else attempts to edit the same record, display lock error message
  - ajax request to update list lock indicators every minute or so (not full page refresh)
  - add ajax request every minute to check if any records in the viewed list are locked,
    or if there have been any changes (check by querying to webdb mysql_log table)
  - if records have been changed, update data table (without refreshing page) and display
    alert bar along top of screen
  - if user clicks edit before data has had a chance to update, display latest data in
    edit form but alert the user (alert bar along top of screen) that data has changed

* event handlers
  - on_field_default_value
  - on_form_dispatch_begin
  - on_form_dispatch_end
  - on_user_authenticate
